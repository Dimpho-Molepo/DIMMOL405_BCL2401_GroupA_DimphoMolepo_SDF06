## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview
In this project we were tasked to create a simple Instagram profile page using the tools learned so far from Software development fundamentals. We used mostly focused on CSS layout and styling. The page has to be responsive and function under different screen sizes and devices.


### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: I was able to understand how and when to use Grid and Flexbox to make my page to be well structured. I also think that positioning and aligning content was a bit challenging but I managed to arrange them to the best of my ability and knowledge

- **Responsive Design**: This sections was a little bit challenging but I tried my utmost to make sure I deliver what was expected from me, although I'm not fully satisfied with with how Profile section looks when the screen is shrinked. i still need to practice this section and master it fully.

- **Styling Elements**: This part was a bit easier than the rest of the other parts. I was able to style most of the elements and make them look like the real Instagram page.


#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: This was really challenging to change the sizes of the contents to fit and still look good across various devices and screen sizes.

- **Hover and Focus Effects**: The hover and focus effect were not as bad as I thought they would be because we already did a button-project that give a bit of key inside into understanding how hover and focus effects work.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: This is an area that needs to be carefully needs to be revised and studied. 

- **Code Optimization**: This always room for improvement in terms of optimizing the code. I will investigate and find alternate methods to achieve the same outcomes using a cleaner code.

- **Creative Design Choices**: I tried my best to be as creative as possible but I can always improve on some of the choices I made on the styling and design ideas.

#### Overall Learning Experience

This project taught me alot of things I was not aware of. It  revealed alot of CSS techniques that I wasn't familiar with. This project literally forced me to do more research on advanced CSS and made me understand more of the code.
